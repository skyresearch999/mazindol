## Weight Loss Options from Mexico I found - for the stimulant medication shortages
## These are stimulants and alternatives to USA ADHD drugs like adderall, dexedrine, etc

Mazindol is in clinical trials for ADHD and Narcolepsy in ER form, which will be patented.. and cost too much. The original Mazindol 
is still available from Mexico! and Japan etc.

The med shortage created a new market and these work and there are loopholes in the laws to allow use of these. 
I found the site on reddit, they import into USA and then resell at a profit. URL is:

I last ordered on 4/1/25 so its conveinent. 4 day shipping if in USA.

I Use Cashapp to buy bitcoin and then you can send from that. The site shows a QR code you can scan in cashapp/a wallet app.
